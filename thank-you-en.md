# Important message

As you may have noticed, the further development of Guess Your Friends has stalled in recent months. Since it unfortunately doesn't look like this is going to change any time soon, __Guess Your Friends will be discontinued as of May 31st, 2020__. 

Even though many people may not be aware of it, there is no big company behind Guess Your Friends, but most of the work was done by me alone in my spare time. Due to the time-consuming processing of notifications and the unfortunately quite complex bureaucracy (Hello, tax office!), the further development often suffered. Nevertheless, I enjoyed doing this very much and it was always a special pleasure when one of you happily reported that you met someone special on the app. 

After the app was initially only meant as an experiment to test some interesting technologies, my expectations were exceeded by far. Since the first release in June 2017 several milestones have been reached:

- Over 50.000 downloads
- Over 1,000 active users daily
- Over 110,000 uploaded profile pictures
- Over 2.5 million games
- Over 16 million messages sent
- Almost 5,000 suggested questions

...and two more impressive records: 
- The highest current friendship level: Level 161 (!)
- The most messages exchanged in one game: over 37.500

Even if some of you behaved badly in Guess Your Friends, the vast majority of you made it very enjoyable. I met several people there myself, and I can count them among my close friends by now, and I know that many of you feel the same way - and I'm really proud of that!

If you still want to stay in touch with your friends at Guess Your Friends after the end of May, you should exchange your contact information until then. After that date, it will no longer be possible to chat with each other, nor will you be able to access old chats. All personal data will be irrevocably deleted on June 1, 2020. If you want to export your chats, please use the screenshot function of your smartphone. If you have any questions you can still get help at contact@asumaone.com.

Goodbye, take care of yourself and stay healthy!
