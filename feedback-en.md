# Feedback

__Do you have suggestions, ideas, criticism or compliments? Here is how you can reach us:__
    - The preferred option is the built-in feedback form in the app settings. If you write to us right there, we will get back to you as soon as possible and answer directly.
    - Another possibility is to send us an e-mail to contact@asumaone.com. There you can also attach screenshots or other information. We will answer as soon as possible.
    - The last option is a review on the Play Store. If you are satisfied, we are happy and a positive rating motivates us to continue to give our best and improve the app. But if you're dissatisfied, it is better to send us an email or use the feedback form to send us your feedback. There is only 250 characters available in the Play Store to answer, so we can't answer your questions there. Also, we're sure we can resolve your issue, so a negative rating would be a pity.

__Your feedback is very important to us. Only you can tell us what you want, so use the opportunity and tell us your opinion! We take it seriously and respond to every message!__
