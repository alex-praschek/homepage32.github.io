This privacy policy applies regardless of the domains, systems, platforms and devices (e.g. desktop or mobile) on which the application is running.
    - The terms used, such as „personally identifiably information“ or their „processing“, we refer to the definitions in Art. 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    - The personally identifiable information processed in the context of this application includes inventory data (e.g., name, location, country and date of birth of customers), content data (e.g., profile pictures and chat messages), meta data (e.g., device IDs) and usage data (e.g., match histories and crash reports).
    - The term „user“ covers all categories of data subjects. These include our customers, interested people and other visitors to our platform.
    - We process personal user data only in compliance with the relevant data protection regulations. This means that user data will only be processed if a legal permission has been obtained. This means, in particular if data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract (e.g. provision of the service) or is required by law, if the user has given his or her consent, or if our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation and security of our online services within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f.
